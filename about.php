            <div class="content652 bio">
                <p>I moved to San Francisco from New York in 1987. From the beginning, I've loved the Bay Area's outdoor lifestyle and free-spirited culture and the innovation and optimism of the high-tech industry. My first job in high-tech was as a researcher and reporter at MacWEEK, the newsweekly publication that was the voice of the Macintosh in the 80s. While at the magazine, I got hooked on the challenges of writing about complex technology in layman's terms.</p> 
                <p>In 1990, I took a job with a small PR agency that had NeXT Computer as its primary client. My time with NeXT was an intense learning experience, but the work didn't involve writing.  So in 1994, I hung out my own communications consulting shingle. My first newsletter project quickly evolved to marketing collateral, advertising copy, customer stories, white papers, user guides, technical booklets, and more. As the web developed, web content became a primary piece of my business.</p>
                <p>Today, nine years later, I provide both communications and information design services to high-tech and biotech companies as well as medical and legal service providers. My clients have included established industry players, such as Apple Computer, IBM, Sun, and Netscape, as well as many start-ups. My focus was, and remains, translating complex technical information into understandable prose.</p>
                <p>I have a B.A. with Honors from the College of Letters, Wesleyan University (Middletown, CT).</p>
