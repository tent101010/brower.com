                <p>Deja Views is a paper crafting and scrapbooking company that approached me for help with ad copy, tag lines and other marketing writing needs. The work required an immersion in the art form of scrapbooking—an interesting departure from the world of high-tech. While the same marketing basics apply—clarity and consistency of message, market differentiation, audience definition, writing for consumers depends much more on emotion, particularly in an industry built on family connections, capturing special moments and reliving memories. As part of my work with Deja Views, I developed several ad campaigns; samples of two of these campaigns are included here.</p>
