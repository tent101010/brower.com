                <p>Today we know NeXT as the company Steve Jobs sold to Apple, but in the early 1990's NeXT was making headlines as a pioneer of object-oriented programming.

But back in 1990, after the introduction of object-oriented NeXTStep in 1990, NeXT had a lot of educating to do. I originally wrote this FAQ about NeXTStep for a press and analyst audience. It was quickly picked up by the company's salesforce to help explain NeXT's technical advantages to potential clients.</p>
