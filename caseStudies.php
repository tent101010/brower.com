                <p>Problem: Ads were happening in a one-off, as-needed way. The client needed a professional-looking campaign &mdash; it's first &mdash; that would accommodate multiple products from its extensive product line.</p>
                <p>Results: The Wow! campaign captured the fast results scrappers get from DV products. Each ad described a 'memory moment' that other scrappers could relate to with a final 'payoff' statement that brings the reader back to the essence of scrapbooking &mdash; family, friends, love.</p>
                <p>Aha: At a tradeshow after the campaign broke, several companies asked who DV ad agency was.</p>
