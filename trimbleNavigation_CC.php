                <p>For several years, I worked with Trimble's corporate marketing department on a variety of projects. I created a customer story program to publicize the many and diverse ways that GPS technology is used around the world. These customer stories were used in corporate newsletters, on the company's first web site and were developed into longer articles and published print media. I also helped to develop the company's first web site and produced its first company-wide product catalog of 100 products for both online and in print.</p>
