                <p>This bioscience product company needed a new taxonomy to help customers navigate the company's 10,000 products, most of which are reagents with names like "Hamster lgG1 k" or "CD3/CD16+CD56". This work was critical to sales; frustrated customers were calling the company's 800 number for help, abandoning their search, or turning to competitors to find what they needed. I worked with a team of web designers and product managers to develop a new product organization and hierarchy that eliminated redundancies and confusion with logical product categories and groupings. The new structure offers customers a clearer path for finding specific products either through browsing or in combination with a new search tool offering.</p>
